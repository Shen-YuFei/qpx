"""Opaque identity hashing for QPX view primary keys.

The ``feature``, ``psm`` and ``pg`` views each carry a single mandatory
identity column (``feature_id`` / ``psm_id`` / ``pg_id``) that is the primary
key of the view. When no producer ID is supplied, the *writer* derives an
**opaque** signed 64-bit integer deterministically from a footer-declared
composite of existing columns (the view's ``identity_composite``). It is not
meant to be parsed or reversed — it is only an identity/equality token.

Because the id is a fixed-width hash of the composite, distinct composites can
in principle collide onto the same id. That is not silently tolerated: the id
is the primary key, and the primary-key **uniqueness** validation
(``duplicate_pk``) catches any collision, so a real clash surfaces as a
validation issue rather than a silent data loss.
